# Installation

To install the `package`, one of the two standard methods for installing
`packages`in R can be adopted. Directly through the
[cran](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Census2010Persons) (choosing
the closest repository):

``` r
install.packages ("Census2010Persons")
```

Or even using the command below. In the latter case, the latest version
of the `package` will be installed.

``` r
# install.packages ("devtools")
devtools::install_github ("AlexandreLoures/Census2010Persons")
```

# Download, read and analyze the microdata

The purpose of this `package` is to provide a user-friendly tool for R
users to download, read and analyse the 2010 Brazilian Census (Persons
Census). These microdata were collected by the Instituto Brasileiro de
Geografia e Estat√≠stica (IBGE) and are available on the official
website: <https://ibge.gov.br/>.
